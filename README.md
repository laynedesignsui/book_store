In this project I created, I used basic tools but also developed some advanced features. These features include a shopping cart with a total amount, multiple different pages, and skeleton loading states. I undertook this project to learn how to create an online store that could potentially be used for various products. You can access the website at https://book-store-ten-blue.vercel.app/
